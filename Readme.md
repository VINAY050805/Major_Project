# 🌿 AI-Driven Crop Disease Prediction and Management System

Deep Learning • Explainable AI • Smart Agriculture

An end-to-end AI system that detects crop diseases from leaf images, explains predictions using Explainable AI, and provides automated treatment recommendations through a web application and chatbot.

This repository contains the implementation of our **Major Project & Research Paper**.

---

## 📌 Overview

Crop diseases significantly reduce agricultural productivity worldwide. Traditional disease detection is:

- Manual and time-consuming  
- Error-prone  
- Not scalable for large farms  

This project proposes an **AI-powered, interpretable, and deployable system** that bridges the gap between disease prediction and real-world farmer support.

The system integrates:
- Image enhancement
- Deep learning models
- Explainable AI (Grad-CAM)
- Treatment recommendation engine
- Farmer chatbot

---

## 🎯 Key Contributions

✔ Image enhancement using **CLAHE** to improve low-quality images  
✔ Comparison of **CNN, VGG16, MobileNetV2** architectures  
✔ Explainable AI using **Grad-CAM heatmaps**  
✔ Automated **treatment recommendation module**  
✔ **Flask web deployment + chatbot integration**  
✔ Tested on **14 crops & 38 diseases** using PlantVillage dataset

## 🧠 System Workflow

1. Upload crop leaf image  
2. Image enhancement using CLAHE  
3. Disease classification using MobileNetV2  
4. Grad-CAM heatmap visualization  
5. Treatment recommendation generation  
6. Chatbot assistance for farmers

## 🤖 Model Comparison

| Model | Accuracy | Loss | Inference Time |
|------|----------|------|----------------|
| CNN | 93.4% | 0.21 | 75 ms |
| VGG16 | 95.7% | 0.15 | 120 ms |
| **MobileNetV2** | **97.8%** | **0.09** | **42 ms** |

🏆 **MobileNetV2 selected for deployment** due to best accuracy and speed.

## 🔍 Explainable AI (Grad-CAM)

To overcome the black-box nature of deep learning models, **Grad-CAM** is used to:

- Highlight diseased regions on leaf images
- Provide visual explanations of predictions
- Increase trust and transparency

---

## 🌱 Treatment Recommendation System

The system provides:

- Chemical treatment suggestions  
- Organic remedies  
- Prevention techniques  

This transforms disease prediction into **actionable agricultural guidance**.

---

## 💬 Farmer Chatbot

Integrated chatbot features:

- Answers disease-related questions  
- Provides prevention tips  
- Helps farmers understand symptoms  
- Offers real-time support
